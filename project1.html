						<h2>Elden Ring Text-Adventure by Adrian Geiss</h2>
						<p>
							My favourite course in the first semester was "Coding Essentials
							2". This course was supposed to introduce us to the basics of
							Object Oriented Programming, or OOP for short. This is a technique
							where you move everything in the code into its own classes and use
							them like a blueprint to create individual instances of the
							object. These instances have the same properties and capabilities,
							but can always take on different values, so that, for example, the
							class Human can have several instances at the same time.<br />The
							aim of this course was to programme a functioning text adventure.
							A text adventure is a kind of computer game in which only the
							console is used as an input field. The player enters text and gets
							back text, no pictures, no complex graphics, just text. This poses
							a new challenge to every programmer, besides programming the
							actual game: What should happen in the first place? So it was not
							only part of our course to learn the basics of OOP, but also to
							stretch our own creativity.<br /><br />
							However, I approached the matter somewhat differently. Since I
							played a lot of the award-winning game Elden Ring in my spare time
							at the beginning of the course, I decided to turn this masterpiece
							into a text adventure. While this decidedly went against the
							principle of "start small and grow with the project", as I had to
							decide rather what all I didn't want to take on, it was incredibly
							fun.<br />Of course, the challenges were different for me. I could
							copy NPC dialogues, but I had to adapt them true to style, or
							split up whole quest series and put them together again. I also
							worked with complex game mechanics from my original, such as the
							absolute foundation of Elden Ring, the battle system. A system
							based on the player seeing what the opponent is doing. A problem
							with a game adaptation where the player cannot see the opponent at
							all because there is only text.<br />But for all these obvious
							hurdles and also for the hidden ones, I successfully found
							solutions and the result, according to testers, turned out
							fantastic.<br />My version of the Game of the Year 2022 can be
							found here:
