						<h2>Pong by Adrian Geiss</h2>
						<h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px">Why Pong?</h3>
						<p>
							The game Pong is an absolute classic. As one of the first video
							games, it has been thrilling vast numbers of gamers for decades.
							Yet there is not much to Pong. All it does is move a ball from one
							side of the screen to the other, thrown back by two moving bars.
							But that's where the charm of Pong comes from. It is simple in
							programming as well as in understanding the game, but at the same
							time it offers a perfect introduction to the world of video games
							or, more generally, to developing.<br />
							Therefore, it was our task in the course "Coding Essentials 1" to
							re-code this legend. We also had to incorporate our own ideas and
							thus create our own variation. My variation was a "block-breaker"
							mode, where a certain number of blocks appear that can be
							destroyed by touching the ball. The aim is to hit all the blocks
							before the ball goes out three times.<br />
							My version of Pong can be found here:
